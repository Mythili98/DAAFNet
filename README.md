# EEG-EmotionRecognition
Dataset used in the study: download DEAP dataset from https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/.

Use analysis-plots.ipynb to understand the underlying distribution of the fused connectivity matrix, which sheds light into how the model would perform on those features.

BC-Model1 - CNN Model without any domain adaptation


BC-AugModel - CNN Model with time series augmentation


eeg_da_skf - Domain adaptive model (Addition to BC-Model1)


eeg_da_skf_Augmodel - Domain Adaptive Model(Addition to BC-AugModel1)
